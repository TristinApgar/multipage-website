            <p>Space, or outspace, is the expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. Space is not a complete empty area, it is actually a almost perfect vacuum, containing a low density of particles, most commonly being plasma of hydrogen and helium. The usualy temperature of space is 2.7 kelvins, or -270 °C; -455 °F. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. 90% of space's mass is unknown form, many people call this unkown form. "dark matter". A majority of other galaxies and start system consist almost entirely of empty space.</p>

        <header>
            <p>We still do not know the correct size of space, but we could have estimates. According to the Big Bang theory, early years of Space was extrememly hot and dense, which caused space to rapidly expand. Later on, Space had cooled down and allowed protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen. </p>

        <h1 class="introducer">Why we explore Space</h1>
        <header>
            <p>We began space explorating during the 20th century with the advancement of high-altitude balloons. Then the balloons were followed by rocket flights. Getting to space was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union. Achieving space travel is incredibly expensive, which limited spaceflight to Earth's orbit and the moon. Yet, many crafts which did not have any living creature in it, has reached all of the known planets in the solar system.</p>
